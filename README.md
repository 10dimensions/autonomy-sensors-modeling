# Autonomy-Sensors-Suite

Project for modeling & simulation sensors utilized in the realization of fully autonomous vehicles.

Some of the most common sensors which could be simulated are:<br/>
-2D LIDAR<br/>
-3D LIDAR<br/>
-RADAR<br/>
-Depth Camera<br/>
-Semantic Segmentation<br/>
<br/>

### 2D Lidar (non-rotating):

This implements a static 2D Lidar which can be used for Range Detection.<br/>
Parameters:<br/>
-Range (in m) <br/>
-Frequency (in ms) <br/>
-Field of View (radial resolution)<br/>
